This repository contains the implementation of a Machine Learning-Based Network Security Framework aimed at detecting network intrusions. It includes the following features:--

!! Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature encoding, and scaling for optimal model performance.

!! Feature Selection: Employing Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify critical features for classification.

!! Classification Models: Includes Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models, among others, for high-accuracy intrusion detection.

!! Performance Metrics: Evaluation of model performance through training and testing accuracy.

!! Customizable Pipeline: Modular structure for extending and experimenting with other datasets or algorithms.

Technologies Used:--

Python,
scikit-learn,
LightGBM,
XGBoost,
Seaborn & Matplotlib for visualizations
